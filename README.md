description in the file about what I've learned in the Git + GitHub training

One of the challenges I faced while completing the tasks was looking for information about how to link remote to local repository. Also, another challenge was to create a new file and after make a commit.  


One of the things I learned from the hands-on experience was how to use Git properly since I haven't worked with this application before.
